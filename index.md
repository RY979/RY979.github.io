I like to think before I act and take initiative when something needs direction. I enjoy finding creative ways to keep things moving smoothly toward the goal. My experience includes:<br>
• A co-op at TJX focusing on store operations and analytics<br>
• Internship at Sephora focusing on merchandising<br>
• Internships with Taco Bell brand marketing<br>
You can learn more about my background on the <a href="./about" style="color:#4DB2C2;">About</a> page.
