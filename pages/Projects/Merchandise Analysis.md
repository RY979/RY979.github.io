## Key Insights

#### 1. Customer Value and Buying Behavior

- Average CLV: **2,852**  
- Average Orders per Customer: **6.21**  
- Repurchase Rate: **0.98**, showing strong retention

High-spending customers tend to place more orders. These buyers are ideal targets for loyalty programs or personalized promotions.

---

#### 2. Sales Performance Over Time

- Steady revenue growth from **2016 to 2018**
- Increase in both **sales and number of customers**
- Strong seasonal pattern with **higher sales in November and December**

This indicates potential for holiday campaigns, bundling offers, and seasonal pricing strategies.

---

#### 3. Geographic Opportunities

- Revenue is concentrated in **California, New York, Texas, and Washington**
- Central states show lower sales performance

Regional merchandising strategies could help expand growth in underdeveloped areas.

---

#### 4. Product Category Performance

| Category | Share of Total Sales |
|----------|----------------------|
| Technology | 60.3% |
| Furniture | 21.2% |
| Office Supplies | 18.5% |

Technology contributes most revenue, but it's also a concentration risk. Furniture and Office Supplies could be strong candidates for bundling, promotions, or cross-selling.

---

#### 5. Shipping Mode and Service Quality

- Standard Class: **59.79%** of all shipments  
- Average shipping delay: **3.96 days**

Faster delivery options are underused and may not meet customer expectations. Priority shipping for high-value buyers could improve satisfaction.
