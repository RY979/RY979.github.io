<p style="font-size: 19px; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Marmaxx Store Operations and Field Escalation Co-op (2025 Spring)</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 19px; margin-top: 4px;">
At TJX, I supported the Marmaxx Store Operations team by building dashboards in Power BI that visualized trends in store-level issues, attrition, and customer experience. I also worked on field escalation projects like revising dressing room layouts and analyzing the impact of cashier-on-wheels in high-traffic locations. I often collaborated with cross-functional teams and store managers to bring data into everyday decision making.

At Sephora, I worked across online and offline channels to support seasonal launches and core assortment planning.

Later, I focused more on performance metrics across delivery platforms, helping improve campaign results and reporting.
